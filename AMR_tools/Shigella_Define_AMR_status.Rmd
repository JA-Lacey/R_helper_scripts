#Data for AMR and SNPS can be obtained by running AbriTAMR with the --species Escherichia flag or SNPs can also be obtained from sonneityper.

#XDR defined as per CDC, which defines XDR Shigella as strains that are resistant to all commonly recommended empiric and alternative antibiotics â€” azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and ampicillin.  

#Azithromycin resistance is encoded by macrolide resistance genes such as mph(A) and erm(B)
#Ciprofloxacin resistance is primarily due to mutations in the gyrA gene (QRDR region)
#Quinilone resistance is primary in Shigella is due to mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA and parC genes but there can be additional mechanism encoded on plasmids (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS) 
#Ceftriaxone resistance is to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), such as blaCTX-M.
#Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistence is due to multiple genes in combination such as sul1 and sul2, and drfA* genes
#Ampicillin resistance is commonly due to beta-lactamase production, such as blaOXA-1like and blaTEM genes (but the CTX-Ms also do this)

#MDR is resistance to atleast 3 classes but not the full complement of XDR these can carry a blaCTX or either a blaTEM-1 or a blaOXA-1. 
#Here we also split the MDR into 2 categories, ESBL carrying and non-ESBL carrying to assist with further discrimination. 

###Special Notes
#trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) - is treated as one antibiotic so for resistance needs both genes to be present
#Ciprofloxacin resitance is due to either 3 mutaitons in QRDR or 1 or 2 and the presence of a plasmid gene. 
#AMR_Beta-lactamase (unknown), AMR_Beta-lactamase (narrow), AMR_Streptomycin, AMR_Tetracycline, AMR_Efflux,	AMR_Other antimicrobial are all not importnat in shigella so will be ignored despite being valid gene ouputs from abritamr
#need to make a column in input with header "AMR_num QRDR" - this will be a value of 0-3 with the number of QRDR mutations observed. (this is a standard ouput if use sonneityper but if determining from abritmar snps then this will need to be done)
